Currently working on

- Data Science and Complexity for Society: massive analyses of data coming from Social Media Platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.) to understand social dynamics, information diffusion and, more broadly, Internet environment. At [CDCS](https://cdcs.di.uniroma1.it/){:target="_blank"}

- Photonic Computing: Light can be used to perform computations at the speed of light (!). [How?](https://www.newcomplexlight.org/){:target="_blank"}. More genrally the intersection between Optics and AI is intriguing me.
