I defedend my Ph.D. thesis "Advances in Coherent Raman Scattering" at Politecnico di Milano, with advisors [Prof. Dario Polli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariopolli){:target="_blank"} and Prof. Giulio Cerullo, getting the title **cum laude**.

Coherent Raman Scattering (CRS) is a non-linear (involves high-power lasers) optical technique to probe matter and get chemical information.
When used within a (very particular) microscope, it offers the inforomation of spatial distribution of chemicals, and that's a promising and relevant application in biomedical field.

Durinng the Ph.D. I assisted to the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, and I studied some application of AI to CRS and non-linear optics:
- A denoising [filter](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0007821){:target="_blank"} based on Deep Learning: an innovative solution for a long standing problemin the field.

- An automated [control system](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.414634){:target="_blank"} based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to set-up and optimize the generation of ultrabroadband light pulses, cornerstone of spectroscopy applications.
